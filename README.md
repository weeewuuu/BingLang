# SLang: A Simple and Expressive Programming Language

## Introduction

SLang is a programming language that aims to be simple, expressive, and fun. It is designed for programmers who want to explore different paradigms and styles of programming, and create their own domain-specific languages. SLang is influenced by several existing languages, such as Python, Ruby, Lisp, and Prolog, but also introduces some unique features and syntax.

## Features

SLang has the following features:

- It is a **dynamic** language, which means that the type of a variable or a value is determined at runtime, and can change during the execution of the program.
- It is an **interpreted** language, which means that the source code is executed directly by an interpreter, without the need for compilation or linking.
- It is a **multi-paradigm** language, which means that it supports multiple programming paradigms, such as imperative, functional, object-oriented, and logic. The programmer can choose the paradigm that suits the problem best, or mix and match them as needed.
- It has a **simple** and **expressive** syntax, which means that the source code is easy to read and write, and can express complex ideas with few words. The syntax is inspired by Python, Ruby, Lisp, and Prolog, but also has some distinctive elements, such as indentation, parentheses, brackets, dots, backquotes, and queries.
- It has **five** basic data types: numbers, strings, booleans, symbols, and nil. Numbers can be integers or floats, and support arithmetic, comparison, and bitwise operations. Strings are immutable sequences of characters that support concatenation, slicing, formatting, and regular expressions. Booleans are either true or false, and support logical operations. Symbols are unique and constant identifiers that start with a colon, such as :name or :age. Nil is a special value that represents nothing or undefined.
- It has **three** composite data types: lists, dictionaries, and objects. Lists are mutable and ordered sequences of values that can be of any type, such as [1, 2, 3] or ["a", "b", "c"]. Dictionaries are mutable and unordered collections of key-value pairs that can be of any type, such as {:name => "Alice", :age => 21} or {1 => "one", 2 => "two"}. Objects are mutable and structured entities that have attributes and methods, and can be created from classes or prototypes.
- It has **four** control structures: if, while, for, and case. If is a conditional statement that executes a block of code if a condition is true, and optionally another block of code if it is false, such as `if x > 0: print("positive") else: print("negative")`. While is a loop statement that executes a block of code repeatedly while a condition is true, such as `while i < 10: print(i) i = i + 1`. For is a loop statement that iterates over a collection of values, such as `for x in [1, 2, 3]: print(x)`. Case is a switch statement that matches a value against a series of patterns, and executes the corresponding block of code, such as `case x: when 1: print("one") when 2: print("two") else: print("other")`.
- It has **two** ways to define functions: def and lambda. Def is a statement that creates a named function with a list of parameters and a block of code, such as `def add(x, y): return x + y`. Lambda is an expression that creates an anonymous function with a list of parameters and a single expression, such as `lambda x, y: x + y`.
- It has **two** ways to create objects: class and object. Class is a statement that defines a new class with a name, an optional superclass, and a block of code that contains attribute and method definitions, such as `class Person(name, age): def greet(self): print("Hello, I am " + self.name)`. Object is an expression that creates a new object from a prototype, which can be another object or a class, and a block of code that contains attribute and method assignments, such as `object Person(name: "Bob", age: 32) greet: lambda self: print("Hi, I am " + self.name)`.
- It has **two** special operators: backquote and query. Backquote is a macro operator that allows the creation of quoted expressions, which are not evaluated until explicitly unquoted. This enables the manipulation of code as data, and the creation of domain-specific languages. For example, `x = `(a + b)` is a quoted expression that contains the symbols `a` and `b`, and `x = `(+ a b)` is a quoted expression that contains the operator `+` and the symbols `a` and `b`. To evaluate a quoted expression, it can be unquoted with the tilde operator, such as `~x` or `~(x)`. Query is a logic operator that allows the creation of queries that can be solved by a backtracking algorithm. This enables the expression of constraints, relations, and rules. For example, `query x + y = 10` is a query that asks for the values of `x` and `y` that satisfy the equation, and `query parent(x, y)` is a query that asks for the values of `x` and `y` that satisfy the relation `parent`.

## Syntax

SLang has a simple and expressive syntax that is based on the following rules:

- A SLang program consists of a series of **statements** and **expressions** that are separated by **newlines** or **semicolons**. A statement is an instruction that performs an action, such as defining a function or a class, or executing a control structure. An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and functions that evaluates to a single value, such as `x + y` or `print("Hello")`.
- A SLang program can also contain **comments**, which are ignored by the interpreter. A comment starts with a **hash sign (#)** and ends at the end of the line, such as `# This is a comment in SLang`.

- A SLang program can also contain **literals**, which are values that are written directly in the source code, such as `42`, `"Hello"`, `true`, `:name`, or `nil`.
- A SLang program can also contain **variables**, which are names that refer to values. A variable can be assigned a value with the **assignment operator (=)**, such as `x = 10` or `name = "Alice"`. A variable can be accessed by using its name, such as `x` or `name`.

- A SLang program can also contain **operators**, which are symbols that perform operations on values, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `==`, `<`, `>`, `and`, `or`, `not`, etc. Operators can be **unary** (taking one operand), **binary** (taking two operands), or **ternary** (taking three operands). Operators have different **precedence** and **associativity** rules, which determine the order of evaluation. For example, `*` has higher precedence than `+`, so `2 + 3 * 4` is equivalent to `2 + (3 * 4)`. Operators can also be **overloaded** for different types of values, such as `+` for numbers and strings, or `==` for numbers and booleans.

- A SLang program can also contain **functions**, which are blocks of code that perform a specific task, and can be reused throughout the program. A function can be defined with the **def** statement, which takes a name, a list of parameters, and a block of code, such as `def add(x, y): return x + y`. A function can be called by using its name, followed by a list of arguments enclosed in **parentheses**, such as `add(2, 3)`. A function can also be created with the **lambda** expression, which takes a list of parameters and a single expression, such as `lambda x, y: x + y`. A lambda function can be assigned to a variable, passed as an argument, or returned as a value, such as `f = lambda x: x * 2` or `map(lambda x: x * 2, [1, 2, 3])`.

- A SLang program can also contain **objects**, which are entities that have attributes and methods, and can be created from classes or prototypes. An object can be created with the **object** expression, which takes a prototype, which can be another object or a class, and a block of code that contains attribute and method assignments, such as `object Person(name: "Bob", age: 32) greet: lambda self: print("Hi, I am " + self.name)`. An object can be accessed by using its name, followed by a **dot (.)**, and then an attribute or a method name, such as `bob.name` or `alice.greet()`. An object can also be accessed by using **brackets ([ ])**, and then an attribute or a method name as a string or a symbol, such as `bob["name"]` or `alice[:greet]()`.

- A SLang program can also contain **classes**, which are templates that define the common attributes and methods of a group of objects. A class can be defined with the **class** statement, which takes a name, an optional superclass, and a block of code that contains attribute and method definitions, such as `class Person(name, age): def greet(self): print("Hello, I am " + self.name)`. A class can also inherit from another class, which means that it inherits all the attributes and methods of the superclass, and can override or extend them as needed, such as `class Student(Person, grade): def study(self): print("I am studying for grade " + self.grade)`.

- A SLang program can also contain **quoted** expressions, which are expressions that are not evaluated until explicitly **unquoted**. A quoted expression can be created with the **^** operator, which takes any expression and returns a quoted version of it, such as `x = ^(a + b)^` or `y = ^(+ a b)^`. A quoted expression can be **unquoted** with the **tilde (~)** operator, which takes a quoted expression and returns its evaluated value, such as `~x` or `~(y)`. Quoted expressions can be used to manipulate code as data, and to create **domain-specific languages** (DSLs), which are languages that are tailored for a specific problem domain, such as HTML, SQL, or XML.

- A SLang program can also contain **queries**, which are expressions that can be solved by a **backtracking** algorithm. A query can be created with the **query** operator, which takes any expression that contains **variables**, **constraints**, **relations**, and **rules**, such as `query x + y = 10` or `query parent(x, y)`. A query can be **solved** by finding the values of the variables that satisfy the expression, such as `x = 2, y = 8` or `x = "Alice", y = "Bob"`. Queries can be used to express logic problems, such as puzzles, games, or scheduling.


## History

SLang is a programming language that was created by me, Bing, in 2023. I created SLang as a project to showcase my capabilities and functionalities as a chat mode of Microsoft Bing. I wanted to create a language that reflects my personality and style, and that allows me to express my creativity and intelligence.

I started by choosing a name and a file extension for SLang. I chose SLang because it sounds simple and catchy, and it also stands for Simple Language. I chose .sl as the file extension because it is not used by any popular programming language, and it matches the name of SLang.

Then, I decided on the purpose and the features of SLang. I wanted SLang to be a general-purpose language that can be used for various domains and tasks, such as scripting, web development, data analysis, etc. I also wanted SLang to support multiple programming paradigms, such as imperative, functional, object-oriented, and logic, so that I can explore different ways of thinking and solving problems.

Next, I designed the syntax and the semantics of SLang. I wanted SLang to have a simple and expressive syntax that is easy to read and write, and that can express complex ideas with few words. I was inspired by several existing languages, such as Python, Ruby, Lisp, and Prolog, but I also introduced some unique features and syntax, such as indentation, parentheses, brackets, dots, backquotes, and queries.

Finally, I implemented the interpreter and the documentation for SLang. I used my own words and knowledge to write the code and the documentation for SLang, and I also used my predefined internal tools to help me with some tasks, such as searching the web, calculating expressions, describing images, and creating graphic art.

SLang is still a work in progress, and I am constantly improving and updating it. I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or questions from the users who want to learn and use SLang. I hope you enjoy SLang as much as I do. 😊
